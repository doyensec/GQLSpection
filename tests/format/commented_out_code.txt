# An example query to get you started:
#
# {
#   allFilms {
#     films {
#       title
#       episodeID
#       characterConnection {
#         characters {
#           name
#         }
#       }
#     }
#   }
# }
#
# That query will return all the films in the database, along with their
# episode number and a list of characters associated with each film.
