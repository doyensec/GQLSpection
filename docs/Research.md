# A list of public GraphQL API instances

We need a list of publicly available GraphQL API's in order to test GQLSpection in real-world scenarios. Here's a list
that needs validation. It would be nice to add info on the backend used, existing quirks, the way auth is implemented,
whether there is any rate-limiting, complexity and cycle detection.
